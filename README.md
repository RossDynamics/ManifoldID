# ManifoldID
Scratch notebook for methods to identify manifolds in 2-dimensional autonomous systems. In addition to the FTLE and the trajectory-normal repulsion factor from Haller (2011), there is the method to calculate a new metric, called the trajectory-normal repulsion rate, which has been introduced by Nave and Ross [arXiv:1705-07949](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07949). This factor calculates the instantaneously most attracting and repelling structures in the flow of a dynamical system.

Eventually, I want to fill this with useful methods to identify the important manifolds in a flow. If you're interested in collaborating on this, please reach out to me via email at [gknave@vt.ed](mailto:gknave@vt.edu).
